            This was our first gantt chart. It started in the second week of the project and ended once we had our client meeting.
            We felt this was a good time frame as this was our first big milestone, and we had to complete user requirements 
            and questions beforehand. This plan was achievable and we most of the deliverables seen. We did not start the risk register
            as we had not thought much about. 
            However, looking back on our process, it would have been beneficial to create this plan earlier as we made it mid-week.

            This week we decided it was more beneficial to make a full representation of our full project in our gantt chart.
            This plan is likely to change as we are unsure of times and completion dates. We have included some dependencies, 
            i.e. we cannot start the implementation without the architectural diagrams. By this point we had our client meeting
            and we had finished the user requirements, after some guidance. 
            Not all tasks have been assigned to a team member as of yet as the tasks have not been fully broken down. 
            This week we made this plan quickly which
            was very beneficial. However, we need the plan to be more detailed.

            After a QnA session we realised it was beneficial to start the implementation even earlier than expected.
            This makes our project more parallel; implementation is less dependent on architecture. At this point we have still split
            ourselves into smaller teams to make the work more manageable. However, during in-person meeting we tend to work on
            tasks together instead. When we are away for the holiday period we expect to work more in our teams.

            It was harder to plan this weeks workload as the team is now remote due to the holiday period. 
            It was up to the individual groups to decide their course of action. The plan stayed the roughly same as in these weeks 
            there is just work to carry on with. The implementation team is nearer the beginning of their set of tasks. This means that the work
            that they plan to do this week is slightly more ambiguous. They hope to be able to get the design of the game more concrete 
            and then start to get some of the simple functionalities working.

            This week was focused on the implementation team as they started to implement some basic features. 
            To do this they had their own meetings to discuss their individual tasks. 
            The plan for this week is to make a start on more architectural diagrams and finalise the requirement tables. 
            This is to make sure that the implementation is as clear as possible, and to help with the documentation.

            We plan to do some work this week but we haven't structured it much as everyone still has holiday plans.
            This week is more for individual work and catch-up rather than working within our smaller teams. 
            The class diagram should have been completed but it is still in its initial stages, and needs more refinement. 
            This will be possible once the implementation team have familiarised themselves with LibGDX and know the best and easiest 
            ways to organise the code.

            At this point the architectural diagrams should be all completed, however, we are behind schedule. 
            The class diagrams need to be properly formatted and finalised but are otherwise completed. 
            The CRC cards haven't been grouped into control styles, and we currently only have four state diagrams. 
            It is very important we finish the diagrams by this week. To help with this we need to communicate with 
            the implementation team more.

            This was exam week so we did not plan to meet over this period. By the end of this week

            On the 16th of January we had a whole team meeting as term had re-started. 
            We realised that the implementation was behind schedule and this needed prioritising.
            The architecture is being finalised and the write-up has now started. We need to 
            iterate the CRC cards again and check that the code matches the diagrams. By the end of this 
            all the write-ups were well underway, the crc cards were iterated and grouped, and the 
            state diagrams finalised. The class diagrams were refined once after discussions with the
            implementation team about game screens and libGDX's own classes.
